Sure, I'd be happy to answer your questions about ArrayList in Java 8.

1. **When to use?**
    - Use an ArrayList when you need a dynamic array-like data structure in Java. It's commonly used to store and
      manipulate a list of elements.

2. **What is the principal usage?**
    - ArrayList is used to store a collection of elements, and it allows for easy insertion, deletion, and retrieval of
      elements based on their index.

3. **What is the main advantage?**
    - The main advantage of ArrayList is its dynamic resizing. It can grow or shrink as needed, making it suitable for
      situations where you don't know the size of the list in advance.

4. **What is the main disadvantage?**
    - The main disadvantage is that inserting or removing elements in the middle of an ArrayList is relatively slow
      compared to other data structures like LinkedList. This is because elements may need to be shifted to accommodate
      the change.

5. **When not to use?**
    - Avoid using ArrayList when you need frequent insertions or deletions in the middle of the list. In such cases,
      LinkedList might be a better choice.

6. **What is the Big O cost?**
    - The average time complexity for common operations on an ArrayList is as follows:
        - Insertion/Deletion at the end: O(1) amortized time
        - Insertion/Deletion at the beginning or middle: O(n)
        - Accessing an element by index: O(1)

7. **What is the Memory and HD costs?**
    - ArrayList consumes memory for the elements it stores. The memory cost is proportional to the number of elements.
      It doesn't have a direct relation to the hard drive (HD) as it's a runtime data structure, but it can be
      serialized to disk if needed.

8. **What other data structure is similar?**
    - An alternative data structure similar to ArrayList is LinkedList. LinkedList is better suited for frequent
      insertions and deletions in the middle of the list.

9. **Is it thread safe?**
    - No, ArrayList is not inherently thread-safe. If you need thread safety, you should use synchronized collections or
      use concurrent collections like `CopyOnWriteArrayList`.

10. **How to make it immutable?**

- You can make an ArrayList immutable by wrapping it with `Collections.unmodifiableList`. For example:

 ```java
 List<String> immutableList=Collections.unmodifiableList(originalList);
 ```

11. **How to make it singleton?**

- To make an ArrayList a singleton (i.e., a list with a single element), you can simply add the element you want and
  ensure that no other elements are added or removed.

12. **What part of Java Memory this structure is stored (Heap, stack, other)?**

- ArrayList, like most objects in Java, is stored in the heap memory. Stack memory is typically used for method call
  frames and local variables, while the heap is used for objects that have a longer lifetime. ArrayList's elements are
  also stored in the heap.

Please note that Java 8 has been superseded by newer versions of Java (e.g., Java 11, Java 17), but the concepts related
to ArrayList remain largely consistent across Java versions.

The `ArrayList` class in Java provides a variety of methods for manipulating and accessing elements in the list. Here
are some of the main methods:

1. **Adding Elements**:
    - `add(E e)`: Appends the specified element to the end of the list.
    - `add(int index, E element)`: Inserts the specified element at the specified position in the list.

2. **Accessing Elements**:
    - `get(int index)`: Returns the element at the specified index.
    - `indexOf(Object o)`: Returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified element.
    - `lastIndexOf(Object o)`: Returns the index of the last occurrence of the specified element.

3. **Removing Elements**:
    - `remove(int index)`: Removes the element at the specified index.
    - `remove(Object o)`: Removes the first occurrence of the specified element.
    - `clear()`: Removes all elements from the list.

4. **Size and Capacity**:
    - `size()`: Returns the number of elements in the list.
    - `isEmpty()`: Returns `true` if the list is empty.
    - `ensureCapacity(int minCapacity)`: Increases the capacity of the list, if necessary, to ensure it can hold at
      least the specified number of elements.

5. **Iterating Over Elements**:
    - `forEach(Consumer<? super E> action)`: Performs the given action for each element of the list.
    - `iterator()`: Returns an iterator over the elements in the list.

6. **Array Conversion**:
    - `toArray()`: Returns an array containing all of the elements in the list.

7. **Sublist Operations**:
    - `subList(int fromIndex, int toIndex)`: Returns a view of the portion of the list between the
      specified `fromIndex` (inclusive) and `toIndex` (exclusive).

8. **Sorting and Reversing**:
    - `sort(Comparator<? super E> c)`: Sorts the list according to the order induced by the specified comparator.
    - `reverse()`: Reverses the order of elements in the list.

9. **Checking for Element Existence**:
    - `contains(Object o)`: Returns `true` if the list contains the specified element.

These are some of the most commonly used methods of the `ArrayList` class. ArrayList also implements the `List`
interface, which defines additional methods for working with lists. You can refer to the Java documentation for a
comprehensive list of methods and their
