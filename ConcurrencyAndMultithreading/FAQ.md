Java 8 introduced several enhancements and features related to threads and concurrency. Here, I'll provide an overview
of the key concepts and features in Java 8 for handling concurrency:

1. **Lambda Expressions**: Java 8 introduced lambda expressions, which simplify the syntax for defining and using
   anonymous functions. Lambda expressions are particularly useful in the context of concurrency because they allow you
   to pass behavior (code) as data. This is especially helpful when working with functional interfaces in the
   java.util.function package, such as Predicate, Consumer, and Function, to create concise and expressive code for
   concurrent tasks.

   Example of a lambda expression:
   ```java
   Runnable task = () -> {
       // Code for the task
   };
   ```

2. **Functional Interfaces**: Java 8 introduced several functional interfaces in the `java.util.function` package, such
   as `Supplier`, `Consumer`, `Predicate`, and `Function`. These interfaces are useful for defining and passing behavior
   as arguments to methods, making concurrent code more modular and expressive.

   Example of using a `Consumer` in a multi-threaded context:
   ```java
   List<String> list = Arrays.asList("apple", "banana", "cherry");
   list.forEach(item -> {
       // Code to process each item concurrently
   });
   ```

3. **Streams API**: The Streams API in Java 8 allows you to process sequences of data concurrently. It provides parallel
   stream operations that automatically distribute the work across multiple threads, making it easier to achieve
   parallelism and improve performance for certain tasks.

   Example of using parallel streams:
   ```java
   List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10);
   int sum = numbers.parallelStream()
                   .filter(n -> n % 2 == 0)
                   .mapToInt(Integer::intValue)
                   .sum();
   ```

4. **CompletableFuture**: Java 8 introduced the CompletableFuture class in the `java.util.concurrent` package. This
   class represents a future result of an asynchronous computation and provides a convenient way to work with
   asynchronous and concurrent tasks. CompletableFuture supports composition, chaining, and combining of asynchronous
   tasks.

   Example of using CompletableFuture for asynchronous operations:
   ```java
   CompletableFuture<Integer> future = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> 42);
   future.thenApply(result -> result * 2)
         .thenAccept(finalResult -> System.out.println(finalResult));
   ```

5. **New Date and Time API**: The new Date and Time API (`java.time`) in Java 8 is designed to be thread-safe, making it
   easier to work with date and time calculations in concurrent applications.

   Example of using the Date and Time API:
   ```java
   LocalDateTime now = LocalDateTime.now();
   ```

6. **Concurrent Collections**: Java 8 introduced various concurrent data structures in the `java.util.concurrent`
   package, such as `ConcurrentHashMap` and `ConcurrentLinkedQueue`, which are designed for use in multi-threaded
   applications and provide thread-safe operations.

   Example of using `ConcurrentHashMap`:
   ```java
   Map<String, Integer> concurrentMap = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();
   concurrentMap.put("key", 42);
   ```

In summary, Java 8 brought several enhancements to make concurrent programming easier and more expressive through
features like lambda expressions, functional interfaces, parallel streams, CompletableFuture, and improved support for
handling date and time in a thread-safe manner. These features have continued to evolve in subsequent Java releases, but
Java 8 laid the foundation for modern concurrent programming in the Java ecosystem.

Certainly! CompletableFuture is a class introduced in Java 8 as part of the `java.util.concurrent` package. It
represents a future result of an asynchronous computation or task. CompletableFuture is a powerful and flexible way to
work with asynchronous operations, allowing you to write concurrent code in a more expressive and composable manner.
Here's a more in-depth look at CompletableFuture:

### Key Features and Concepts:

1. **Asynchronous Execution**: CompletableFuture is designed to handle asynchronous operations, which means that it can
   represent tasks that are executed in the background, without blocking the main thread of your application. This is
   particularly useful for tasks that may take time to complete, such as network requests or I/O operations.

2. **Completable**: The name "CompletableFuture" signifies that it can be completed manually by setting its result or
   exception, or it can be completed asynchronously when the underlying task finishes execution.

3. **Composition**: CompletableFuture supports various methods for composing multiple asynchronous operations, such
   as `thenApply`, `thenCompose`, `thenCombine`, and more. These methods allow you to chain operations together and
   specify what should happen when one or more CompletableFuture instances complete.

4. **Exception Handling**: CompletableFuture provides methods for handling exceptions that occur during the execution of
   asynchronous tasks. You can use `exceptionally` or `handle` to define how to handle exceptions.

### Creating CompletableFuture Instances:

You can create instances of CompletableFuture using various factory methods:

- `CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(Supplier<U> supplier)`: Executes a given Supplier asynchronously and returns a
  CompletableFuture that completes when the Supplier's computation is finished.

- `CompletableFuture.runAsync(Runnable runnable)`: Executes a Runnable asynchronously and returns a
  CompletableFuture<Void> that completes when the Runnable's computation is finished.

- `CompletableFuture.completedFuture(T value)`: Creates a completed CompletableFuture with a predefined result value.

### Chaining Operations:

You can chain operations on CompletableFuture instances using methods like `thenApply`, `thenCompose`,
and `thenCombine`. Here's a brief overview of some common methods:

- `thenApply(Function<? super T, ? extends U> fn)`: Applies a function to the result of a CompletableFuture and returns
  a new CompletableFuture with the transformed result.

- `thenCompose(Function<? super T, ? extends CompletionStage<U>> fn)`: Applies a function that returns another
  CompletableFuture, allowing for a sequence of dependent asynchronous operations.

- `thenCombine(CompletionStage<U> other, BiFunction<? super T, ? super U, ? extends V> fn)`: Combines the results of two
  CompletableFutures when they both complete.

### Exception Handling:

You can handle exceptions using methods like `exceptionally` and `handle`:

- `exceptionally(Function<Throwable, ? extends T> fn)`: Handles exceptions that occur in the original CompletableFuture
  and provides an alternative result.

- `handle(BiFunction<? super T, Throwable, ? extends U> fn)`: Handles both the result (if available) and any exceptions
  that occur during the computation.

### Waiting for Completion:

You can wait for a CompletableFuture to complete using methods like `get`, `join`, or `thenAccept` with appropriate
handling of exceptions.

- `get()`: Blocks the current thread until the CompletableFuture completes and returns the result.

- `join()`: Similar to `get()`, but it throws unchecked exceptions instead of checked ones.

### Combining CompletableFutures:

You can combine multiple CompletableFutures using methods like `thenCombine`, `thenCompose`, and `allOf`.

- `allOf(CompletableFuture<?>... cfs)`: Returns a new CompletableFuture that completes when all of the input
  CompletableFutures complete.

- `anyOf(CompletableFuture<?>... cfs)`: Returns a new CompletableFuture that completes when any of the input
  CompletableFutures complete.

### Exception Handling:

Handling exceptions is essential when working with CompletableFutures. You can use methods like `exceptionally`
and `handle` to specify how to handle exceptions.

### Example:

Here's a simple example of using CompletableFuture to perform two asynchronous tasks and combine their results:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture;

public class CompletableFutureExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CompletableFuture<Integer> future1 = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> 5);
        CompletableFuture<Integer> future2 = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> 10);

        CompletableFuture<Integer> combinedFuture = future1.thenCombine(future2, (result1, result2) -> result1 + result2);

        combinedFuture.thenAccept(result -> System.out.println("Combined result: " + result));
    }
}
```

This example creates two CompletableFutures that represent asynchronous computations and then combines their results
using `thenCombine`. Finally, it uses `thenAccept` to print the combined result when it's available.

CompletableFuture is a powerful tool for dealing with concurrency and asynchronous tasks in Java. It enables you to
write more readable and maintainable code when working with parallel and asynchronous operations.
