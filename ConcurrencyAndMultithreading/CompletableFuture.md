# CompletableFuture

`CompletableFuture` is a class introduced in Java 8 as part of the `java.util.concurrent` package. It is a powerful and
flexible asynchronous programming construct that allows you to work with asynchronous operations and compose them in a
more readable and maintainable way. With `CompletableFuture`, you can perform tasks concurrently, handle dependencies
between tasks, and respond to task completion or failure.

Here's a detailed explanation of `CompletableFuture` in Java 8:

### Basic Usage

1. **Creating a CompletableFuture**:
   You can create a new `CompletableFuture` using its constructor or by using factory methods like `supplyAsync`
   or `runAsync`:

   ```java
   CompletableFuture<Integer> future = new CompletableFuture<>();
   CompletableFuture<Void> voidFuture = CompletableFuture.runAsync(() -> {
       // Perform some asynchronous operation
   });
   CompletableFuture<Integer> supplyFuture = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
       // Perform some asynchronous operation and return a result
       return 42;
   });
   ```

2. **Completing a CompletableFuture**:
   You can complete a `CompletableFuture` manually using the `complete`, `completeExceptionally`, or `cancel` methods:

   ```java
   CompletableFuture<Integer> future = new CompletableFuture<>();
   future.complete(42); // Completes the future with a result
   future.completeExceptionally(new RuntimeException("Something went wrong")); // Completes exceptionally
   future.cancel(true); // Cancels the future
   ```

3. **Chaining and Combining**:
   One of the powerful features of `CompletableFuture` is the ability to chain and combine multiple asynchronous tasks.
   You can use methods like `thenApply`, `thenAccept`, `thenCombine`, `thenCompose`, etc., to create a pipeline of
   operations:

   ```java
   CompletableFuture<Integer> future = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> 10);
   CompletableFuture<Integer> resultFuture = future.thenApplyAsync(result -> result * 2)
                                                 .thenApplyAsync(result -> result + 5);
   ```

### Exception Handling

`CompletableFuture` provides various methods for handling exceptions:

- `exceptionally`: Allows you to recover from an exception by providing a fallback value.
- `handle`: Combines the result and exception, allowing you to perform custom error handling and transformation.
- `whenComplete`: Executes a callback when the future completes, regardless of success or failure.

### Combining Futures

You can combine multiple `CompletableFuture` instances using methods
like `thenCombine`, `thenCompose`, `thenCombineAsync`, etc. This is useful for handling multiple asynchronous operations
concurrently and combining their results.

### Waiting for Completion

To wait for the completion of a `CompletableFuture`, you can use the `get` method. Be cautious with this method, as it
can block the current thread until the future is completed.

```java
CompletableFuture<Integer> future=CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(()->42);
        int result=future.get(); // Blocks until the future is completed
```

### Asynchronous Execution

By default, most methods in `CompletableFuture` run asynchronously, but you can control the execution context using
methods like `thenApplyAsync`, `thenComposeAsync`, etc., to specify an `Executor` for execution.

### Handling Multiple Futures

When dealing with multiple `CompletableFuture` instances, you can use methods like `allOf` and `anyOf` to wait for all
or any of them to complete.

```java
CompletableFuture<Integer> future1=CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(()->42);
        CompletableFuture<Integer> future2=CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(()->100);

        CompletableFuture<Void> allOfFuture=CompletableFuture.allOf(future1,future2);
```

### Exception Propagation

If an exception occurs in one of the chained `CompletableFuture` operations, it will propagate down the chain until it's
explicitly handled. You can use methods like `exceptionally` and `handle` to handle exceptions at various points in the
chain.

### Timeouts and Cancellation

`CompletableFuture` supports timeouts using the `completeOnTimeout` method, and you can cancel a future using
the `cancel` method.

### Error Handling

When using `CompletableFuture`, it's essential to handle exceptions properly to prevent silent failures. Always add
appropriate error handling using methods like `exceptionally`, `handle`, or `whenComplete`.

Here's a simple example demonstrating many of these concepts:

```java
CompletableFuture<Integer> future=CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(()->10)
        .thenApplyAsync(result->result*2)
        .thenApplyAsync(result->result+5)
        .exceptionally(ex->{
        System.err.println("Exception: "+ex);
        return-1; // Fallback value
        });

        future.thenAccept(result->System.out.println("Result: "+result));
```

In this example, we create a chain of asynchronous operations, handle exceptions, and then consume the final result when
it's available.

`CompletableFuture` is a powerful tool for writing asynchronous and concurrent code in Java, making it easier to work
with complex asynchronous workflows and parallelism.
