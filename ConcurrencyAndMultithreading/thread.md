Certainly! Multithreading is a powerful and essential concept in Java, especially in Java 8 and beyond, where it plays a
crucial role in optimizing application performance and responsiveness. In this explanation, I'll cover the basics of
multithreading in Java 8 and provide some practical examples to help you understand the concept better.

**What is Multithreading?**
Multithreading is a concurrent execution mechanism that allows a Java program to run multiple threads simultaneously. A
thread is the smallest unit of execution within a process. By using multiple threads, a program can perform multiple
tasks concurrently, taking advantage of the available CPU cores and improving the application's efficiency.

**Advantages of Multithreading:**

1. **Improved Performance**: Multithreading can lead to better CPU utilization by allowing multiple tasks to run
   concurrently.

2. **Responsiveness**: It can enhance user experience by preventing the application from becoming unresponsive while
   performing time-consuming operations.

3. **Simplified Code**: In some cases, multithreading can simplify code by dividing complex tasks into smaller,
   manageable threads.

**Creating Threads in Java:**
In Java, you can create threads in two main ways: by extending the `Thread` class or by implementing the `Runnable`
interface. The latter is the preferred way because it allows you to separate the thread's behavior from the thread
itself, promoting better code organization and reusability.

Here's an example of creating a thread by implementing `Runnable`:

```java
public class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
    public void run() {
        // Code to be executed in the thread
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread thread = new Thread(new MyRunnable());
        thread.start(); // Start the thread
    }
}
```

**Java 8 and Lambda Expressions:**
Java 8 introduced lambda expressions, which make it easier to work with threads and functional interfaces. You can
create threads and execute tasks with concise syntax using lambda expressions. Here's an example:

```java
// Using lambda expression to create a thread
Thread thread=new Thread(()->{
        // Code to be executed in the thread
        });
        thread.start(); // Start the thread
```

**Thread States:**
Threads in Java go through various states during their lifecycle. The main thread states are:

- **New**: A newly created thread that has not yet started.
- **Runnable**: A thread that is ready to run but not necessarily running.
- **Running**: A thread currently executing its code.
- **Blocked**: A thread that is waiting for a resource to become available.
- **Terminated**: A thread that has finished executing.

**Thread Synchronization:**
When multiple threads access shared resources concurrently, you might encounter synchronization issues, such as race
conditions. Java provides synchronization mechanisms like `synchronized` blocks and `Lock` interfaces to ensure that
only one thread accesses a critical section of code at a time, preventing data corruption and unexpected behavior.

```java
public synchronized void synchronizedMethod(){
        // Synchronized code block
        // Only one thread can execute this method at a time
        }
```

**Java 8 Parallel Streams:**
In Java 8, you can also leverage parallel streams to perform operations on collections in a multithreaded manner.
Parallel streams automatically split the data and distribute tasks among available threads, making it easier to take
advantage of multiple cores for parallel processing.

```java
List<Integer> numbers=Arrays.asList(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8);

// Using parallel stream for parallel processing
        int sum=numbers.parallelStream()
        .mapToInt(Integer::intValue)
        .sum();
```

In summary, multithreading is a vital concept in Java 8 and beyond, allowing you to improve application performance,
responsiveness, and resource utilization. By creating and managing threads, understanding thread states, and using
synchronization mechanisms, you can harness the power of multithreading to build efficient and responsive Java
applications. Additionally, Java 8's lambda expressions and parallel streams simplify the process of working with
threads and concurrent operations.
