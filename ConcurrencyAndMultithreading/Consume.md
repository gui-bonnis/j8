# Consumer

In Java 8, the `Consumer` interface is a part of the `java.util.function` package, which introduced functional
programming constructs to the Java language. The `Consumer` interface represents an operation that takes a single input
argument and returns no result. It's often used when you need to perform some action on an object without returning any
value.

Here is the declaration of the `Consumer` interface:

```java

@FunctionalInterface
public interface Consumer<T> {
    void accept(T t);
}
```

- `@FunctionalInterface`: This annotation indicates that the `Consumer` is a functional interface, meaning it has only
  one abstract method (in this case, `accept`).

- `<T>`: This is a generic type parameter. It represents the type of the input argument to the `accept` method.

- `void accept(T t)`: This is the single abstract method of the `Consumer` interface. It takes an argument of type `T`
  and performs some operation on it without returning any value.

You can use the `Consumer` interface in various scenarios, such as:

1. **Processing Elements in a Collection**: You can use a `Consumer` to iterate through a collection and perform an
   action on each element, such as printing or modifying them.

   ```java
   List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);

   // Using a Consumer to print each element
   Consumer<Integer> printConsumer = (Integer num) -> System.out.println(num);
   numbers.forEach(printConsumer);
   ```

2. **File I/O**: When reading or writing data to a file, you can use a `Consumer` to process the data as it's read or
   written.

   ```java
   // Writing data to a file using a Consumer
   try (BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter("output.txt"))) {
       Consumer<String> fileConsumer = (String line) -> {
           try {
               writer.write(line);
               writer.newLine();
           } catch (IOException e) {
               e.printStackTrace();
           }
       };

       // Process and write data to the file
       List<String> data = Arrays.asList("Line 1", "Line 2", "Line 3");
       data.forEach(fileConsumer);
   } catch (IOException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
   ```

3. **Database Operations**: You can use a `Consumer` to define what should be done with database records fetched from a
   query.

   ```java
   List<User> users = userRepository.findAll();

   // Using a Consumer to process each user record
   Consumer<User> processUser = (User user) -> {
       // Perform some operation on the user, e.g., update or display
       System.out.println(user.getName());
   };

   users.forEach(processUser);
   ```

4. **Thread Synchronization**: In concurrent programming, you can use `Consumer` to define what should be done by a
   thread when processing data.

   ```java
   // Using a Consumer to perform a task in a separate thread
   Consumer<String> taskConsumer = (String task) -> {
       // Perform some time-consuming task
       System.out.println("Task started: " + task);
       // ...
       System.out.println("Task completed: " + task);
   };

   // Create and start a new thread to execute the task
   Thread thread = new Thread(() -> taskConsumer.accept("Thread Task"));
   thread.start();
   ```

In summary, the `Consumer` interface in Java 8 is a functional interface that represents an operation that accepts an
input argument and performs some action on it. It's widely used for tasks where you need to apply a behavior or action
to objects without returning any result.

# Supplier

In Java 8, the `Supplier` interface is another functional interface provided in the `java.util.function` package. It
represents a supplier of results, meaning it has no input arguments and is used to produce or supply a value.
The `Supplier` interface is commonly used in scenarios where you need to generate or provide a value, such as lazy
initialization or when working with data sources.

Here is the declaration of the `Supplier` interface:

```java

@FunctionalInterface
public interface Supplier<T> {
    T get();
}
```

- `@FunctionalInterface`: This annotation indicates that the `Supplier` is a functional interface, which means it has
  only one abstract method (in this case, `get`).

- `<T>`: This is a generic type parameter representing the type of the value that the `get` method will supply.

- `T get()`: This is the single abstract method of the `Supplier` interface. It doesn't take any arguments and returns a
  value of type `T`.

You can use the `Supplier` interface in various scenarios, such as:

1. **Lazy Initialization**: You can use a `Supplier` to defer the initialization of an object until it's actually
   needed.

   ```java
   Supplier<ExpensiveObject> lazyInit = () -> {
       System.out.println("Initializing expensive object...");
       return new ExpensiveObject();
   };

   // The object is initialized only when 'get' is called
   ExpensiveObject obj = lazyInit.get();
   ```

2. **Generating Random Values**: You can use a `Supplier` to generate random values.

   ```java
   Supplier<Integer> randomValue = () -> (int) (Math.random() * 100);

   // Get a random integer value
   int randomNumber = randomValue.get();
   ```

3. **Data Source Retrieval**: When working with data sources like databases or web services, you can use a `Supplier` to
   fetch data when needed.

   ```java
   Supplier<List<User>> userDataSupplier = () -> userRepository.getAllUsers();

   // Fetch user data when needed
   List<User> users = userDataSupplier.get();
   ```

4. **Configuration**: You can use a `Supplier` to provide configuration values.

   ```java
   Supplier<String> configSupplier = () -> ConfigurationManager.getConfigValue("app.apiKey");

   // Get the API key from the configuration when needed
   String apiKey = configSupplier.get();
   ```

5. **Memoization**: In memoization, you can use a `Supplier` to cache and return previously computed results for a given
   input.

   ```java
   Map<Integer, Integer> cache = new HashMap<>();
   Supplier<Integer> computeValue = () -> {
       int input = 5; // For example purposes
       if (!cache.containsKey(input)) {
           cache.put(input, expensiveComputation(input));
       }
       return cache.get(input);
   };

   // Get the computed value or compute it if not in the cache
   int result = computeValue.get();
   ```

In summary, the `Supplier` interface in Java 8 is a functional interface used for supplying values or generating results
without taking any input arguments. It's particularly useful in situations where you want to delay the creation or
retrieval of a value until it's actually needed, or when you need to provide a value-producing mechanism in a functional
context.

# Predicate

In Java 8, the `Predicate` interface is part of the `java.util.function` package and represents a functional interface
for defining a test or condition on an input. A `Predicate` takes an argument of a certain type and returns a boolean
value (`true` or `false`) to indicate whether the condition is satisfied for that argument.

Here is the declaration of the `Predicate` interface:

```java

@FunctionalInterface
public interface Predicate<T> {
    boolean test(T t);
}
```

- `@FunctionalInterface`: This annotation indicates that the `Predicate` is a functional interface, meaning it has only
  one abstract method (in this case, `test`).

- `<T>`: This is a generic type parameter representing the type of the input object that will be tested by the `test`
  method.

- `boolean test(T t)`: This is the single abstract method of the `Predicate` interface. It takes an object of type `T`
  and returns a boolean value indicating whether the given condition holds for that object.

You can use the `Predicate` interface in various scenarios, such as:

1. **Filtering Collections**: You can use `Predicate` to filter elements in a collection based on a specified condition.

   ```java
   List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10);

   // Filter even numbers using a Predicate
   Predicate<Integer> isEven = num -> num % 2 == 0;
   List<Integer> evenNumbers = numbers.stream()
                                      .filter(isEven)
                                      .collect(Collectors.toList());
   ```

2. **Validation**: You can use `Predicate` to validate input data by defining various validation rules.

   ```java
   Predicate<String> isValidEmail = email -> email.matches("[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,4}");
   
   if (isValidEmail.test("example@email.com")) {
       System.out.println("Valid email address");
   } else {
       System.out.println("Invalid email address");
   }
   ```

3. **Conditional Execution**: You can use `Predicate` to conditionally execute code blocks.

   ```java
   int value = 42;
   Predicate<Integer> isGreaterThan30 = num -> num > 30;
   
   if (isGreaterThan30.test(value)) {
       System.out.println("Value is greater than 30");
   } else {
       System.out.println("Value is not greater than 30");
   }
   ```

4. **Combining Predicates**: You can combine multiple `Predicate` instances using logical operators like `and`, `or`,
   and `negate`.

   ```java
   Predicate<Integer> isEven = num -> num % 2 == 0;
   Predicate<Integer> isPositive = num -> num > 0;
   
   Predicate<Integer> isEvenAndPositive = isEven.and(isPositive);
   ```

5. **Functional Programming**: `Predicate` is widely used in functional programming and can be passed as an argument to
   higher-order functions that operate on collections, such as `filter`, `anyMatch`, `allMatch`, and `noneMatch`.

   ```java
   List<String> names = Arrays.asList("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David");
   
   boolean allNamesHaveLengthGreaterThan3 = names.stream()
                                                .allMatch(name -> name.length() > 3);
   ```

In summary, the `Predicate` interface in Java 8 is a functional interface that represents a condition or test that can
be applied to an input object. It's often used for filtering, validation, conditional execution, and functional
programming operations where boolean conditions play a significant role.

# Function

In Java 8, the `Function` interface is a part of the `java.util.function` package and represents a functional interface
for defining a transformation operation on an input and producing a result. It takes an argument of one type and returns
a result of another type. The `Function` interface is commonly used for operations where you need to transform data or
apply a computation to an input value.

Here is the declaration of the `Function` interface:

```java

@FunctionalInterface
public interface Function<T, R> {
    R apply(T t);
}
```

- `@FunctionalInterface`: This annotation indicates that the `Function` is a functional interface, meaning it has only
  one abstract method (in this case, `apply`).

- `<T>`: This is a generic type parameter representing the type of the input object.

- `<R>`: This is a generic type parameter representing the type of the result produced by the `apply` method.

- `R apply(T t)`: This is the single abstract method of the `Function` interface. It takes an argument of type `T` and
  returns a result of type `R`.

You can use the `Function` interface in various scenarios, such as:

1. **Data Transformation**: You can use a `Function` to transform data from one type to another.

   ```java
   Function<String, Integer> stringToLength = str -> str.length();
   int length = stringToLength.apply("Hello, World!"); // Returns 13
   ```

2. **Mapping**: You can use `Function` to map elements in a collection to a new type.

   ```java
   List<String> names = Arrays.asList("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David");
   List<Integer> nameLengths = names.stream()
                                   .map(stringToLength)
                                   .collect(Collectors.toList());
   ```

3. **Chaining Functions**: You can chain multiple `Function` instances to perform a sequence of transformations.

   ```java
   Function<Integer, Integer> doubleValue = num -> num * 2;
   Function<Integer, Integer> addFive = num -> num + 5;
   
   Function<Integer, Integer> composedFunction = doubleValue.andThen(addFive);
   int result = composedFunction.apply(10); // First doubles (10 * 2), then adds five (20 + 5), result is 25
   ```

4. **Optional Mapping**: When working with `Optional` objects, you can use a `Function` to map the value inside
   the `Optional`.

   ```java
   Optional<String> maybeName = Optional.of("John");
   Optional<Integer> nameLength = maybeName.map(stringToLength);
   ```

5. **Functional Programming**: `Function` is widely used in functional programming, especially when dealing with streams
   and transformations of data.

   ```java
   List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
   List<Integer> squaredNumbers = numbers.stream()
                                         .map(num -> num * num)
                                         .collect(Collectors.toList());
   ```

In summary, the `Function` interface in Java 8 is a functional interface used for defining transformation operations on
an input value, resulting in a computed output value. It's versatile and commonly used for data manipulation, mapping,
and functional programming operations.

# Others

In Java 8 and later versions, the `java.util.function` package provides several specialized functional interfaces that
extend the basic `Function` interface to handle different scenarios and input/output types. Here are some of the
commonly used specialized functional interfaces:

1. **UnaryOperator<T>**:
    - This functional interface extends `Function<T, T>`.
    - It takes a single argument of type `T` and returns a result of the same type `T`.
    - It's often used for functions that transform an input of a certain type into the same type.

   ```java
   UnaryOperator<Integer> square = x -> x * x;
   int result = square.apply(5); // Returns 25
   ```

2. **BinaryOperator<T>**:
    - This functional interface extends `BiFunction<T, T, T>`.
    - It takes two arguments of type `T` and returns a result of the same type `T`.
    - It's used for binary operations that take two inputs and produce a single output of the same type.

   ```java
   BinaryOperator<Integer> addition = (x, y) -> x + y;
   int result = addition.apply(3, 4); // Returns 7
   ```

3. **Predicate<T>**:
    - As discussed earlier, this functional interface takes an argument of type `T` and returns a `boolean` result.
    - It's used for testing conditions on an input.

4. **Consumer<T>**:
    - As discussed earlier, this functional interface takes an argument of type `T` but does not return any result (
      void).
    - It's used for performing actions or operations on an input.

5. **Supplier<T>**:
    - As discussed earlier, this functional interface takes no arguments and returns a result of type `T`.
    - It's used for supplying or generating values.

6. **BiFunction<T, U, R>**:
    - This functional interface takes two arguments of types `T` and `U` and returns a result of type `R`.
    - It's used for functions that require two inputs to produce an output.

   ```java
   BiFunction<Integer, Integer, Integer> multiply = (x, y) -> x * y;
   int result = multiply.apply(3, 4); // Returns 12
   ```

7. **BiPredicate<T, U>**:
    - This functional interface takes two arguments of types `T` and `U` and returns a `boolean` result.
    - It's used for testing conditions involving two inputs.

   ```java
   BiPredicate<Integer, Integer> isEqual = (x, y) -> x.equals(y);
   boolean result = isEqual.test(5, 5); // Returns true
   ```

8. **BiConsumer<T, U>**:
    - This functional interface takes two arguments of types `T` and `U` but does not return any result (void).
    - It's used for performing actions or operations involving two inputs.

   ```java
   BiConsumer<String, Integer> printStringAndNumber = (str, num) -> System.out.println(str + ": " + num);
   printStringAndNumber.accept("Count", 10); // Prints "Count: 10"
   ```

These specialized functional interfaces in the `java.util.function` package make it easier to work with different types
of functions and provide a more expressive and type-safe way to define operations in functional programming and data
manipulation tasks.
