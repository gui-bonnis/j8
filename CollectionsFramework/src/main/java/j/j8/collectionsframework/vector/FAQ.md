In Java 8, the `Vector` class is one of the data structures available for use. Let's go through your questions:

1. **When to use?**
    - You can use `Vector` when you need a dynamically resizable array-like data structure that is synchronized, meaning
      it's thread-safe. Java 8 introduced more modern alternatives, such as `ArrayList` and `LinkedList`, which are
      generally preferred for most use cases.

2. **What is the principal usage?**
    - The principal usage of `Vector` is to store and manipulate collections of objects. It can be used to hold elements
      of any type.

3. **What is the main advantage?**
    - The main advantage of `Vector` is its thread safety. It ensures that multiple threads can safely access and modify
      it without causing data corruption.

4. **What is the main disadvantage?**
    - The main disadvantage of `Vector` is its performance in multi-threaded scenarios. The synchronization overhead can
      make it slower than non-synchronized alternatives like `ArrayList`. Additionally, it's considered somewhat
      outdated in modern Java development.

5. **When not to use?**
    - You should avoid using `Vector` in scenarios where you don't require thread safety or need high-performance
      operations. In most cases, `ArrayList` or other non-synchronized collections are a better choice.

6. **What are the main methods of this structure?**
    - Some of the main methods of `Vector` include `add()`, `get()`, `set()`, `remove()`, `size()`, and `isEmpty()`. It
      provides similar methods to those found in `ArrayList`.

7. **What is the Big O cost?**
    - The Big O cost for common operations in a `Vector` is similar to that of an `ArrayList`:
        - Insertion (add): O(1) amortized time
        - Deletion (remove): O(n) time, as it may require shifting elements
        - Access (get/set): O(1) time
        - Search (indexOf): O(n) time

8. **What is the Memory and HD costs?**
    - `Vector` consumes memory for its elements, which is similar to other dynamic arrays like `ArrayList`. The exact
      memory usage depends on the number and size of elements stored. The "HD cost" (hard disk) is not directly related
      to the data structure itself but depends on how it's used in your program.

9. **What other data structure is similar?**
    - Similar data structures in Java include `ArrayList` and `CopyOnWriteArrayList` (for thread-safety with better
      performance in read-heavy scenarios).

10. **Is it thread-safe?**
    - Yes, `Vector` is thread-safe because it uses synchronization to ensure that multiple threads can safely access and
      modify its contents.

11. **How to make it immutable?**
    - You can make a `Vector` immutable by not providing any public methods that allow modification after creation.
      However, if you need an immutable list, consider using `Collections.unmodifiableList()` with an `ArrayList`
      instead.

12. **How to make it singleton?**
    - You can create a singleton `Vector` by using the Singleton design pattern, where you ensure that only one instance
      of the `Vector` exists. However, this is an unusual use case for `Vector`, and you should consider other
      approaches for creating singletons in Java.

13. **What part of Java Memory this structure is stored (Heap, stack, other)?**
    - Like most Java objects, `Vector` instances are stored in the heap memory. Local variables and method call stacks
      are stored on the stack, but the objects they refer to, including `Vector`, are on the heap.
