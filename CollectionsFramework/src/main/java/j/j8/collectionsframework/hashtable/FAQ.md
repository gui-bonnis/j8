In Java 8, the `HashTable` data structure you mentioned is typically referred to as `Hashtable` (note the lowercase 't'
in `Hashtable`). Here are answers to your questions:

1. **When to use?**
    - `Hashtable` is a synchronized and thread-safe data structure, so it can be used in multi-threaded environments
      where thread safety is essential. It's suitable for scenarios where you need to store and retrieve key-value pairs
      with thread safety guarantees.

2. **What is the principal usage?**
    - The principal usage of `Hashtable` is to store key-value pairs, similar to a dictionary or a map. It allows you to
      associate keys with values and quickly retrieve values based on their keys.

3. **What is the main advantage?**
    - The main advantage of `Hashtable` is its thread safety. It ensures that multiple threads can access and modify it
      concurrently without causing data corruption or race conditions.

4. **What is the main disadvantage?**
    - The main disadvantage of `Hashtable` is its performance in highly concurrent environments. Because it's
      synchronized, it can lead to performance bottlenecks when many threads are accessing it simultaneously.

5. **When not to use?**
    - You should avoid using `Hashtable` when you don't need thread safety. If your application is single-threaded or
      you can manage thread safety using other mechanisms, such as `ConcurrentHashMap`, it's better to use a
      non-synchronized data structure for better performance.

6. **What are the main methods of this structure?**
    - Some of the main methods of `Hashtable` include `put(key, value)`, `get(key)`, `remove(key)`, `containsKey(key)`,
      and `containsValue(value)`, among others.

7. **What is the BigO cost?**
    - The time complexity for common operations on `Hashtable` is O(1) on average for operations
      like `get`, `put`, `remove`, `containsKey`, and `containsValue`.

8. **What is the Memory and HD costs?**
    - `Hashtable` consumes memory proportional to the number of key-value pairs it stores. The exact memory usage
      depends on factors like the size of the table and the hash code distribution of keys. As for hard disk (HD)
      costs, `Hashtable` is an in-memory data structure, so it doesn't have a direct association with hard disk storage.

9. **What other data structure is similar?**
    - `HashMap` is a similar data structure to `Hashtable` in Java. However, unlike `Hashtable`, `HashMap` is not
      synchronized, making it more suitable for single-threaded or non-concurrent scenarios. For concurrent
      use, `ConcurrentHashMap` is a better choice.

10. **Is it thread safe?**
    - Yes, `Hashtable` is thread-safe due to its internal synchronization mechanisms.

11. **How to make it immutable?**
    - You cannot make a `Hashtable` immutable directly. However, you can wrap it with an unmodifiable view
      using `Collections.unmodifiableMap(hashTable)` to prevent modifications.

12. **How to make it singleton?**
    - You can create a singleton `Hashtable` instance by using a static field and a private constructor in a class.
      Ensure that only one instance is created and accessed through a static method.

13. **What part of Java Memory this structure is stored (Heap, stack, other)?**
    - `Hashtable` is stored in the Java Heap memory because it is a dynamically allocated data structure. It is created
      on the heap when you instantiate it using the `new` keyword, and its memory is managed by the JVM's garbage
      collector.

Remember that in modern Java, you might prefer to use other data structures like `HashMap` or `ConcurrentHashMap`
over `Hashtable` for improved performance in many scenarios.
