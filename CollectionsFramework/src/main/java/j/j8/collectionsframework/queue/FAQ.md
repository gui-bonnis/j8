In Java 8, the Queue data structure is a part of the Java Collections Framework. It represents a linear data structure
where elements are stored in a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) manner. Here are answers to your questions:

1. **When to use?**
    - Use a Queue when you need to manage elements in a FIFO order, like processing tasks in the order they were added.

2. **What is the principal usage?**
    - Queues are commonly used in scenarios such as task scheduling, implementing breadth-first search algorithms,
      handling requests in web applications, and more.

3. **What is the main advantage?**
    - The main advantage of a Queue is its efficient insertion and removal of elements in FIFO order, making it suitable
      for managing tasks and maintaining order.

4. **What is the main disadvantage?**
    - The main disadvantage is that accessing elements in the middle of the Queue is not efficient, as it requires
      iterating through the Queue.

5. **When not to use?**
    - Avoid using a Queue when you need quick access to elements by their index or when elements need to be sorted in a
      different order.

6. **What are the main methods of this structure?**
    - Common Queue methods include `add()`, `offer()`, `remove()`, `poll()`, `element()`, and `peek()`. These methods
      are used to add, remove, and access elements in the Queue.

7. **What is the BigO cost?**
    - The Big O cost for common Queue operations is generally O(1) for insertion (enqueue) and removal (dequeue)
      operations. However, accessing elements by index or searching for elements has a cost of O(n), where n is the
      number of elements in the Queue.

8. **What is the Memory and HD costs?**
    - The memory cost depends on the size of the Queue and the type of elements it holds. In terms of hard disk (HD)
      costs, Queues are typically used in-memory and don't have a direct association with hard disk storage.

9. **What other data structure is similar?**
    - The `Deque` (Double-Ended Queue) is similar to a Queue but allows elements to be added or removed from both
      ends. `LinkedList` can also be used as a Queue or Deque.

10. **Is it thread-safe?**
- The Java Queue interface itself does not provide thread safety. However, you can make it thread-safe by using
  thread-safe implementations like `ConcurrentLinkedQueue` or by synchronizing access using explicit locks.

11. **How to make it immutable?**
- You can make an immutable Queue by wrapping it in an unmodifiable wrapper using `Collections.unmodifiableQueue()`.

12. **How to make it singleton?**
- You can create a singleton Queue instance by using the Singleton design pattern, ensuring that only one instance of
  the Queue is ever created and providing access to it through a static method.

13. **What part of Java Memory this structure is stored (Heap, stack, other)?**
- The Queue and its elements are stored in the heap memory, like most Java objects. The stack is primarily used for
  managing method calls and local variables.
