ConcurrentHashMap is a key-value data structure introduced in Java 5 but improved upon in Java 8. It is designed to
provide thread-safe, highly concurrent access to its elements. Here are answers to your questions:

1. **When to use?**
    - ConcurrentHashMap is useful in multi-threaded applications where you need to perform concurrent read and write
      operations on a map-like data structure.

2. **What is the principal usage?**
    - The principal usage of ConcurrentHashMap is to provide a concurrent and thread-safe replacement for the regular
      HashMap when you have multiple threads accessing and modifying the map concurrently.

3. **What is the main advantage?**
    - The main advantage is its high concurrency level. It allows multiple threads to read from and write to the map
      concurrently without causing data corruption or inconsistencies.

4. **What is the main disadvantage?**
    - ConcurrentHashMaps have some performance overhead compared to non-concurrent hash maps due to the synchronization
      mechanisms used to achieve thread safety. Additionally, they do not allow null keys or values.

5. **When not to use?**
    - You might not want to use ConcurrentHashMap when you have a single-threaded application or when the overhead of
      synchronization is not justified by the level of concurrent access to the map.

6. **What are the main methods of this structure?**
    - Some of the main methods
      include `put()`, `get()`, `remove()`, `compute()`, `computeIfAbsent()`, `computeIfPresent()`, `merge()`, and
      various iterator methods.

7. **What is the Big O cost?**
    - In general, the time complexity for basic operations (get, put, remove) is O(1) on average. However, in rare
      cases, it can degrade to O(n) if there are too many hash collisions.

8. **What is the Memory and HD costs?**
    - ConcurrentHashMaps consume memory for storing key-value pairs and synchronization data structures. The exact
      memory cost depends on the number of entries and the implementation details.

9. **What other data structure is similar?**
    - Other similar data structures in Java include Hashtable, Collections.synchronizedMap(), and various
      implementations of the java.util.concurrent interfaces.

10. **Is it thread safe?**
    - Yes, ConcurrentHashMap is designed to be thread-safe, allowing multiple threads to access and modify it
      concurrently without external synchronization.

11. **How to make it immutable?**
    - You can make an immutable copy of a ConcurrentHashMap by creating a new instance and populating it with the data
      from the original ConcurrentHashMap. Since ConcurrentHashMap itself is mutable, you need to ensure that no further
      modifications are made to the copied instance.

12. **How to make it singleton?**
    - To make a ConcurrentHashMap a singleton, you can use a design pattern like the Singleton pattern, ensuring that
      only one instance is created and used throughout your application.

13. **What part of Java Memory this structure is stored (Heap, stack, other)?**
    - ConcurrentHashMap instances are typically stored in the Java heap memory. This is where most objects in Java,
      including collections like ConcurrentHashMap, are allocated and managed.

Remember that while ConcurrentHashMap provides thread-safety for individual operations, you still need to ensure the
correctness of higher-level operations, which may involve multiple method calls, by carefully designing your concurrent
algorithms.
