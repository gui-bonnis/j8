Java 8 introduced several enhancements to the Java Collections Framework, including improvements to existing data
structures like TreeSet. Let's address your questions one by one:

1. **When to use TreeSet (Java 8):**
    - Use TreeSet when you need a collection that maintains elements in sorted order and you want to take advantage of
      its unique features like efficient element retrieval and range queries.

2. **Principal Usage:**
    - TreeSet is typically used when you need to store a set of elements in sorted order, and you want to perform
      operations like insertion, deletion, and search efficiently in a sorted context.

3. **Main Advantage:**
    - The primary advantage of TreeSet is that it maintains elements in sorted order (according to their natural
      ordering or a custom comparator), which allows for efficient operations like finding the minimum or maximum
      element and performing range queries.

4. **Main Disadvantage:**
    - The main disadvantage of TreeSet is that it does not allow duplicate elements. If you need to store duplicates,
      you should use a different data structure like a HashSet or LinkedHashSet.

5. **When Not to Use:**
    - You should not use TreeSet when you need to store duplicate elements, as it automatically removes duplicates.
    - TreeSet may not be the best choice when you need constant-time access to elements (e.g., by index) because it's
      optimized for log-time access.

6. **Main Methods:**
    - Some of the main methods of TreeSet
      include `add`, `remove`, `contains`, `first`, `last`, `ceiling`, `floor`, `higher`, `lower`, and more for various
      set operations.

7. **Big O Cost:**
    - The Big O cost for common operations in TreeSet:
        - Insertion (add): O(log n)
        - Deletion (remove): O(log n)
        - Searching (contains): O(log n)
        - Minimum (first): O(1)
        - Maximum (last): O(1)

8. **Memory and HDD Costs:**
    - TreeSet consumes memory proportional to the number of elements it contains, so the memory cost is O(n).
    - HDD (Hard Disk Drive) cost is not applicable here since TreeSet is an in-memory data structure.

9. **Similar Data Structure:**
    - TreeMap is a similar data structure that stores key-value pairs sorted by keys, whereas TreeSet stores a sorted
      set of elements.

10. **Thread Safety:**
    - TreeSet is not thread-safe by default. If you need to use it in a multi-threaded environment, you should
      synchronize access to it externally or consider using a thread-safe alternative
      like `Collections.synchronizedSortedSet()`.

11. **How to Make it Immutable:**
    - To make a TreeSet immutable, you can wrap it using `Collections.unmodifiableSortedSet()`. This will prevent any
      modifications to the TreeSet after wrapping it.

12. **How to Make it Singleton:**
    - A TreeSet cannot be a singleton because it's designed to store multiple elements in sorted order. Singleton
      patterns are typically used for classes that have only one instance.

13. **Memory Storage:**
    - A TreeSet is stored on the heap, like most Java objects. It is not stored on the stack.

Keep in mind that while Java 8 introduced some improvements to the Collections Framework, these principles apply to
TreeSet in earlier Java versions as well.
