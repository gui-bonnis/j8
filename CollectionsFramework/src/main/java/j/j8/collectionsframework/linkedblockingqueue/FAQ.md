LinkedBlockingQueue is a concurrent data structure introduced in Java 5, not specifically in Java 8, but it's still
relevant in Java 8 and later versions. Let me answer your questions about LinkedBlockingQueue:

1. **When to use?**
    - You should use a LinkedBlockingQueue when you need a thread-safe, blocking queue implementation in a
      multi-threaded environment. It's particularly useful in scenarios where multiple producers and consumers are
      interacting, and you want to ensure thread safety and efficient coordination between them.

2. **What is the principal usage?**
    - The primary usage of LinkedBlockingQueue is to facilitate communication and synchronization between producer and
      consumer threads. Producers can add elements to the queue, and consumers can remove them, with built-in blocking
      behavior for cases where the queue is empty or full.

3. **What is the main advantage?**
    - LinkedBlockingQueue offers built-in thread safety and blocking operations, making it easy to implement efficient
      producer-consumer patterns without the need for explicit synchronization.

4. **What is the main disadvantage?**
    - The main disadvantage is that it has a fixed capacity. Once the queue is full, any attempt to add more elements
      will block until there is space available. Conversely, when the queue is empty, attempts to remove elements will
      block until there are elements to remove.

5. **When not to use?**
    - You should not use LinkedBlockingQueue in single-threaded applications or scenarios where blocking behavior is not
      desired. If you need an unbounded queue or a non-blocking queue, there are other options available.

6. **What are the main methods of this structure?**
    - Some of the main methods include `add`, `offer`, `put` (for adding elements), `poll`, `take` (for removing
      elements), `size`, and `isEmpty`.

7. **What is the Big O cost?**
    - The average time complexity for `add`, `offer`, `poll`, and `take` operations is O(1), which means they are
      generally very efficient. However, in the worst case, the performance can degrade to O(n) due to thread
      contention.

8. **What is the Memory and HD costs?**
    - LinkedBlockingQueue consumes memory for storing its elements, and the memory usage grows as elements are added.
      There are no HD (hard disk) costs associated with it unless you decide to persist the queue to disk.

9. **What other data structure is similar?**
    - Other similar data structures in Java's concurrent package include `ArrayBlockingQueue`, `PriorityBlockingQueue`,
      and `ConcurrentLinkedQueue`.

10. **Is it thread-safe?**
    - Yes, LinkedBlockingQueue is thread-safe. It uses internal locks to ensure that multiple threads can safely access
      and modify the queue concurrently.

11. **How to make it immutable?**
    - LinkedBlockingQueue is inherently mutable, so you cannot make it immutable. You would need to create a new class
      that wraps or encapsulates a LinkedBlockingQueue and provides only read-only access to it to achieve immutability.

12. **How to make it singleton?**
    - To create a singleton instance of a LinkedBlockingQueue, you can use the Singleton design pattern. Ensure that you
      initialize it lazily and that there's only one instance throughout the application.

13. **What part of Java Memory this structure is stored (Heap, stack, other)?**
    - LinkedBlockingQueue, like most Java objects, is stored in the heap memory. It allocates memory on the heap for its
      internal data structures and elements.

Keep in mind that the specific details of how LinkedBlockingQueue behaves in a Java 8 context remain consistent with its
behavior in later Java versions.
