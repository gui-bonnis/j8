Java 8, like its predecessors, provides the `LinkedList` data structure as part of the Java Collections Framework. Let's
go through your questions one by one:

1. **When to use?**
    - `LinkedList` can be used when you need a dynamic list that frequently requires insertion and deletion of elements
      in the middle of the list, as it provides efficient add and remove operations for elements at the beginning, end,
      and at any position within the list.

2. **What is the principal usage?**
    - `LinkedList` is commonly used for implementing certain data structures like a queue or a stack. It's also used
      when the order of elements matters, but the specific order isn't known in advance, and elements need to be
      frequently inserted or removed.

3. **What is the main advantage?**
    - The primary advantage of a `LinkedList` is its efficient insertion and removal of elements in the middle of the
      list. These operations are typically O(1) for a `LinkedList`.

4. **What is the main disadvantage?**
    - The main disadvantage of `LinkedList` is that accessing elements by index (e.g., `get(index)`) is relatively slow,
      typically O(n) because you have to traverse the list from the beginning or end to reach the desired element.

5. **When not to use?**
    - Avoid using a `LinkedList` when you primarily need fast random access to elements by index. In such cases,
      an `ArrayList` might be more suitable.

6. **What are the main methods of this structure?**
    - Some of the key methods of `LinkedList`
      include `addFirst`, `addLast`, `removeFirst`, `removeLast`, `add`, `remove`, `get`, `size`, and various iterator
      methods.

7. **What is the Big O cost?**
    - The Big O complexities for common operations in a `LinkedList` are:
        - Insertion/Deletion at the beginning or end: O(1)
        - Insertion/Deletion at a specific position: O(n)
        - Access by index: O(n)

8. **What is the Memory and HD costs?**
    - `LinkedList` consumes more memory than arrays (`ArrayList`) because each node in the list requires additional
      memory to store references. The actual memory usage depends on the number of elements in the list and the JVM's
      implementation.

9. **What other data structure is similar?**
    - An alternative to `LinkedList` is `ArrayList`, which provides better random access times (O(1)) but can be less
      efficient for frequent insertions and removals in the middle.

10. **Is it thread-safe?**

- No, `LinkedList` is not inherently thread-safe. If you need thread safety, you must synchronize access to
  the `LinkedList` using mechanisms like `synchronized` blocks or use thread-safe collections
  from `java.util.concurrent`.

11. **How to make it immutable?**

- You can make a `LinkedList` immutable by not providing any methods that modify the list after it's created. You can
  wrap it in an unmodifiable view using `Collections.unmodifiableList()`.

12. **How to make it singleton?**

- To make a `LinkedList` a singleton, create a single instance of it and provide a public static method to access that
  instance.

13. **What part of Java Memory this structure is stored (Heap, stack, other)?**

- A `LinkedList` is stored in the Java heap memory. It's a dynamically allocated data structure that lives on the heap,
  and its elements are objects that also reside on the heap.

The `LinkedList` class in Java provides a variety of methods for manipulating and working with linked lists. Here are
some of the main methods and their descriptions:

1. **Adding Elements:**
    - `add(E e)`: Appends the specified element to the end of the list.
    - `addFirst(E e)`: Inserts the specified element at the beginning of the list.
    - `addLast(E e)`: Appends the specified element to the end of the list.

2. **Removing Elements:**
    - `remove()`: Removes and returns the first element in the list.
    - `remove(int index)`: Removes the element at the specified index in the list.
    - `remove(Object o)`: Removes the first occurrence of the specified element from the list.
    - `removeFirst()`: Removes and returns the first element in the list.
    - `removeLast()`: Removes and returns the last element in the list.
    - `clear()`: Removes all elements from the list.

3. **Accessing Elements:**
    - `get(int index)`: Returns the element at the specified index in the list.
    - `getFirst()`: Returns the first element in the list.
    - `getLast()`: Returns the last element in the list.

4. **Checking Size and Empty Status:**
    - `size()`: Returns the number of elements in the list.
    - `isEmpty()`: Returns `true` if the list is empty; otherwise, returns `false`.

5. **Iterating through Elements:**
    - `iterator()`: Returns an iterator over the elements in the list.
    - `descendingIterator()`: Returns a reverse-order iterator over the elements in the list.

6. **Other Operations:**
    - `contains(Object o)`: Returns `true` if the list contains the specified element; otherwise, returns `false`.
    - `indexOf(Object o)`: Returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified element in the list, or -1 if not
      found.
    - `lastIndexOf(Object o)`: Returns the index of the last occurrence of the specified element in the list, or -1 if
      not found.
    - `toArray()`: Returns an array containing all of the elements in the list.
    - `toArray(T[] a)`: Returns an array containing all of the elements in the list; the runtime type of the returned
      array is that of the specified array.

These are some of the key methods provided by the `LinkedList` class. You can use these methods to perform various
operations on a linked list, including adding, removing, accessing, and iterating through elements.
