Sure, I can provide you with information about the PriorityQueue data structure in Java 8:

1. **When to Use?**
    - You should use a PriorityQueue when you need to maintain a collection of elements with a specific order based on
      their natural order (using Comparable) or a custom order (using a Comparator). PriorityQueue ensures that the
      highest-priority element is always at the front of the queue.

2. **Principal Usage:**
    - PriorityQueue is often used in algorithms that require processing elements in a specific order, such as Dijkstra's
      algorithm for finding the shortest path in a graph.

3. **Main Advantage:**
    - PriorityQueue provides efficient retrieval of the highest-priority element in O(1) time, making it suitable for
      scenarios where you frequently need to access the most important element.

4. **Main Disadvantage:**
    - The main disadvantage of PriorityQueue is that it doesn't offer efficient access to elements at arbitrary
      positions. To access elements at arbitrary positions, you would need to remove elements until you reach the
      desired position, which could take O(n) time in the worst case.

5. **When Not to Use:**
    - You should avoid using PriorityQueue when you require frequent access to elements at non-front positions or need a
      data structure that supports efficient insertion and deletion of elements at arbitrary positions.

6. **Main Methods:**
    - Some of the main methods in PriorityQueue include `add(E e)`, `remove()`, `peek()`, `poll()`, and `isEmpty()`.

7. **Big-O Cost:**
    - The time complexity for the basic operations in PriorityQueue are as follows:
        - Insertion (add): O(log n)
        - Removal of the highest-priority element (remove/poll): O(log n)
        - Peek (access the highest-priority element without removal): O(1)

8. **Memory and Hard Disk Costs:**
    - PriorityQueue's memory cost depends on the number of elements it holds. It uses a data structure based on a binary
      heap, which typically has a memory overhead proportional to the number of elements.

9. **Similar Data Structure:**
    - A similar data structure is a BinaryHeap, which is the underlying data structure used by PriorityQueue.

10. **Thread Safety:**
- PriorityQueue is not inherently thread-safe. If you need to use it in a multi-threaded environment, you should
  synchronize access to the PriorityQueue using external synchronization mechanisms.

11. **How to Make it Immutable:**
- You can make a PriorityQueue immutable by not providing any mutator methods (methods that modify the PriorityQueue)
  and ensuring that the elements inside it are also immutable.

12. **How to Make it Singleton:**
- To create a singleton PriorityQueue, you can follow the singleton design pattern by ensuring that only one instance of
  the PriorityQueue exists in your application.

13. **Memory Storage:**
- PriorityQueue is stored in the Java heap memory, which is where most Java objects reside. It is not stored on the
  stack.

Remember that in Java, you can use the PriorityQueue class from the `java.util` package to work with PriorityQueue
instances.
