Sure, I can provide you with information about the Deque (Double-ended Queue) data structure in Java 8 based on your
questions.

1. **When to use?**
    - You should use a Deque when you need to efficiently add or remove elements from both ends of a queue-like data
      structure. It's suitable for scenarios where you need a dynamic collection with the ability to insert and remove
      elements from both the front and back.

2. **What is the principal usage?**
    - The primary usage of a Deque is to implement double-ended queues, stacks, and related data structures where
      elements can be added or removed from both ends.

3. **What is the main advantage?**
    - The main advantage of a Deque is its efficient support for insertion and removal at both ends, which allows for
      versatile data manipulation.

4. **What is the main disadvantage?**
    - One of the main disadvantages of Deque is that it is not implemented as a fixed-size data structure, so it can
      potentially consume a significant amount of memory if not used carefully.

5. **When not to use?**
    - You should avoid using a Deque when you only need a simple stack (use `Stack` or `LinkedList` instead) or a simple
      queue (use `Queue` or `LinkedList` instead) because Deque provides more functionality than may be necessary.

6. **What are the main methods of this structure?**
    - Some of the main methods of Deque
      include `addFirst`, `addLast`, `removeFirst`, `removeLast`, `getFirst`, `getLast`, `peekFirst`, `peekLast`, `size`, `isEmpty`,
      etc.

7. **What is the Big O cost?**
    - The Big O complexity of Deque operations depends on the specific implementation. In general, adding or removing
      elements from either end (e.g., `addFirst`, `removeLast`) is typically O(1), while accessing elements in the
      middle or searching for elements is O(n).

8. **What is the Memory and HD costs?**
    - Memory usage depends on the number of elements stored in the Deque. Each element consumes memory, and there may be
      additional memory overhead for the data structure itself. There is no direct association with hard disk (HD) costs
      unless you specifically persist the data structure.

9. **What other data structure is similar?**
    - Similar data structures include `LinkedList`, `ArrayDeque` (a common Deque implementation), and various queue and
      stack implementations.

10. **Is it thread-safe?**
    - Deque implementations in Java 8 are not inherently thread-safe. If you need thread safety, you should
      use `java.util.concurrent` data structures or synchronize access to the Deque manually.

11. **How to make it immutable?**
    - To make a Deque immutable, you can wrap it using `Collections.unmodifiableDeque()`. This method returns a view of
      the Deque that does not allow modifications.

12. **How to make it singleton?**
    - You can make a Deque a singleton by creating a single instance of it and ensuring that no other instances are
      created. You can use the Singleton design pattern for this purpose.

13. **What part of Java Memory this structure is stored (Heap, stack, other)?**
    - The Deque data structure is stored in the heap memory. Heap memory is where Java objects, including data
      structures like Deque, are allocated and managed.

Keep in mind that the specific behavior and performance characteristics of Deque may vary depending on the
implementation you choose, such as `LinkedList` or `ArrayDeque`.
