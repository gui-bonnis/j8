Sure, I can provide you with information about the HashMap data structure in Java 8, including its use cases,
advantages, disadvantages, methods, complexity analysis, thread safety, immutability, singleton pattern, memory storage,
and similar data structures.

1. **When to use?**
    - Use a HashMap when you need to store key-value pairs and need fast access to values based on their keys.
    - It's commonly used for implementing caches, lookup tables, and other data structures where quick access by key is
      important.

2. **Principal Usage:**
    - HashMaps are used to efficiently store and retrieve data based on unique keys. They provide a way to map keys to
      values for quick and easy retrieval.

3. **Main Advantage:**
    - Fast average-case time complexity for insertion, deletion, and retrieval operations (O(1)).

4. **Main Disadvantage:**
    - No order guarantee for the keys or values.
    - Hash collisions can impact performance.
    - Not suitable for applications requiring ordered key-value pairs.

5. **When Not to Use?**
    - If you need to maintain the order of keys or values, consider using a TreeMap or LinkedHashMap.
    - If thread safety is a concern, you may need to synchronize access to the HashMap or use a ConcurrentHashMap.

6. **Main Methods:**
    - Some of the main methods include `put(key, value)`, `get(key)`, `remove(key)`, `containsKey(key)`, `size()`, and
      others.

7. **Big-O Complexity:**
    - Average-case time complexity:
        - Insertion (put): O(1)
        - Deletion (remove): O(1)
        - Lookup (get): O(1)
    - Worst-case time complexity:
        - These operations can degrade to O(n) in cases of hash collisions, but this is rare with a good hash function.

8. **Memory and HD Costs:**
    - HashMap consumes memory to store the key-value pairs and additional memory for internal data structures.
    - The memory cost depends on the number of entries, load factor, and the capacity of the HashMap.

9. **Similar Data Structure:**
    - LinkedHashMap, which maintains the order of insertion.
    - TreeMap, which stores entries in a sorted order based on the keys.

10. **Thread Safety:**
    - HashMap is not thread-safe. For concurrent access, use ConcurrentHashMap.

11. **How to Make it Immutable:**
    - You can make a HashMap immutable by wrapping it using the `Collections.unmodifiableMap()` method.

```java
Map<K, V> immutableMap=Collections.unmodifiableMap(originalMap);
```

12. **How to Make it Singleton:**
    - To make a Singleton HashMap, you can create a private static instance and provide a static method to access it.

```java
public class MySingletonHashMap {
    private static final Map<Key, Value> instance = new HashMap<>();

    private MySingletonHashMap() {
    }

    public static Map<Key, Value> getInstance() {
        return instance;
    }
}
```

13. **Memory Storage:**
    - HashMap data is stored on the heap memory as it is a dynamically allocated data structure. The actual entries (
      key-value pairs) are stored as objects on the heap.

In summary, HashMaps are a versatile data structure in Java used for quick key-value pair retrieval. They are not
thread-safe by default, can be made immutable using `Collections.unmodifiableMap()`, and can be turned into singletons
by controlling access to the instance. They are stored in the heap memory and are suitable for various use cases where
order is not important, and fast access by key is required.
