LinkedHashSet is a data structure in Java that combines the features of both HashSet and LinkedList. It is part of the
Java Collections Framework and is available in Java 8. Let's address your questions one by one:

1. **When to use LinkedHashSet?**
    - LinkedHashSet is useful when you need a collection that maintains the order of elements based on their insertion
      and also provides fast access and retrieval operations. It's suitable for scenarios where you need a Set-like
      collection with predictable iteration order.

2. **What is the principal usage?**
    - The principal usage is to store a set of elements while preserving the order in which they were inserted.

3. **What is the main advantage?**
    - The main advantage of LinkedHashSet is that it combines the uniqueness of a HashSet with the predictable order of
      a LinkedList, making it efficient for both set operations (e.g., checking for the presence of an element) and
      maintaining the order of elements.

4. **What is the main disadvantage?**
    - The main disadvantage is that LinkedHashSet consumes more memory than a regular HashSet due to the need to store
      additional links between elements to maintain order. Additionally, it may have slightly slower insertion and
      removal times compared to a HashSet.

5. **When not to use?**
    - You might avoid using LinkedHashSet when memory consumption is a critical concern and when the order of elements
      doesn't matter.

6. **What are the main methods of this structure?**
    - LinkedHashSet inherits methods from its parent classes, HashSet and LinkedHashMap. Common methods
      include `add`, `remove`, `contains`, `isEmpty`, `size`, `clear`, and iteration methods like `iterator`.

7. **What is the Big O cost?**
    - The average time complexity for basic operations like `add`, `remove`, `contains`, and iteration in a
      LinkedHashSet is O(1) because it is backed by a hash table. However, it also maintains a doubly-linked list to
      preserve order, so some operations may have a slightly higher constant factor compared to a regular HashSet.

8. **What is the Memory and HD costs?**
    - LinkedHashSet consumes more memory than a regular HashSet due to the additional memory required to maintain the
      linked list for order. The exact memory usage depends on the number of elements stored.

9. **What other data structure is similar?**
    - LinkedHashMap is similar to LinkedHashSet in that it maintains order, but it is a Map rather than a Set.

10. **Is it thread safe?**
    - No, LinkedHashSet is not thread-safe. If you need thread safety, you should use synchronized collections or use
      external synchronization mechanisms.

11. **How to make it immutable?**
    - You can make a LinkedHashSet immutable by wrapping it using the `Collections.unmodifiableSet()` method. This will
      prevent any further modifications to the set.

12. **How to make it singleton?**
    - To create a singleton LinkedHashSet, you can use the Singleton design pattern by creating a static final instance
      of LinkedHashSet with only one element or using an enum type.

13. **What part of Java Memory this structure is stored (Heap, stack, other)?**
    - LinkedHashSet, like other objects, is stored in the heap memory. Local variables that reference a LinkedHashSet
      are stored on the stack, but the actual LinkedHashSet object resides in the heap.
