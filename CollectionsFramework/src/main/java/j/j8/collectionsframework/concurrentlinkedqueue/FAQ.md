Java 8 doesn't introduce significant changes to the `ConcurrentLinkedQueue` data structure itself compared to previous
Java versions. It is mainly a concurrent implementation of the `Queue` interface, which was available in previous
versions as well. However, I can provide you with answers to your questions based on the features and characteristics
of `ConcurrentLinkedQueue`:

1. **When to use?**
    - Use `ConcurrentLinkedQueue` when you need a thread-safe, non-blocking, and highly concurrent queue. It's suitable
      for scenarios where multiple threads need to access and manipulate a shared queue without the need for explicit
      locking.

2. **Principal usage:**
    - `ConcurrentLinkedQueue` is commonly used in multi-threaded applications where you want to maintain a collection of
      elements in a queue-like fashion.

3. **Main advantage:**
    - The main advantage of `ConcurrentLinkedQueue` is its high concurrency and non-blocking behavior, making it
      efficient for multi-threaded applications with frequent queue operations.

4. **Main disadvantage:**
    - One potential disadvantage is that it doesn't provide constant-time operations for all operations, unlike some
      other data structures like `ConcurrentHashMap`. It may have higher overhead for some use cases.

5. **When not to use?**
    - You might not want to use `ConcurrentLinkedQueue` when you don't need thread safety or when you require
      constant-time operations for all queue operations, regardless of concurrency.

6. **Main methods:**
    - Some of the main methods include `add`, `offer`, `poll`, `peek`, `size`, and `isEmpty`.

7. **Big O cost:**
    - The typical time complexity for operations is O(1), but it can degrade to O(n) in some cases, such as when
      using `remove(Object o)` or `contains(Object o)`.

8. **Memory and HD costs:**
    - `ConcurrentLinkedQueue` is relatively memory-efficient compared to some other concurrent data structures. It
      doesn't have a significant memory or hard disk cost beyond the memory used to store the elements.

9. **Similar data structure:**
    - `ConcurrentLinkedDeque` is a similar data structure that allows you to insert and remove elements from both ends
      of the queue.

10. **Thread safety:**
    - `ConcurrentLinkedQueue` is thread-safe, designed for concurrent access by multiple threads without the need for
      external synchronization.

11. **How to make it immutable:**
    - You can't directly make a `ConcurrentLinkedQueue` immutable. If you need an immutable version, consider creating a
      new collection (e.g., an immutable list) from the elements of the queue.

12. **How to make it singleton:**
    - To create a singleton `ConcurrentLinkedQueue`, you can use a Singleton design pattern where you ensure that only
      one instance of the queue is created and provide access to it through a static method.

13. **Memory storage:**
    - `ConcurrentLinkedQueue` instances are stored in the Java heap memory as regular objects. The elements themselves
      are also stored in the heap. The internal data structure of the queue uses nodes, and these nodes are stored in
      the heap as well.

Remember that while `ConcurrentLinkedQueue` provides thread safety for individual operations, you still need to consider
the overall synchronization and logic in your application to ensure correctness when using it in a multi-threaded
environment.
