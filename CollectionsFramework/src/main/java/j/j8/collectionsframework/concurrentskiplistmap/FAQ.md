ConcurrentSkipListMap is an interesting data structure in Java 8, and I'll address your questions one by one:

1. **When to use?**
    - Use ConcurrentSkipListMap when you need a concurrent, sorted map that provides logarithmic time complexity for
      most operations. It's suitable for scenarios where multiple threads need to access and modify the map concurrently
      while maintaining its sorted order.

2. **What is the principal usage?**
    - It is primarily used to implement a concurrent sorted map, meaning it maintains the elements in sorted order while
      allowing multiple threads to access and modify it concurrently.

3. **What is the main advantage?**
    - The main advantage is its concurrency support. It allows multiple threads to perform operations concurrently
      without the need for external synchronization, while still maintaining the sorted order of elements.

4. **What is the main disadvantage?**
    - The primary disadvantage is that it may have slightly higher memory overhead compared to non-concurrent data
      structures. Additionally, some operations may have higher latency due to concurrent access control.

5. **When not to use?**
    - Avoid using ConcurrentSkipListMap when you don't need concurrent access or when the overhead of concurrent access
      control is not justified. In such cases, a regular TreeMap may be more efficient.

6. **What are the main methods of this structure?**
    - ConcurrentSkipListMap provides various methods for common map operations like `put`, `get`, `remove`, and also
      methods for navigating the map, such as `ceilingEntry`, `floorEntry`, etc.

7. **What is the Big O cost?**
    - The Big O cost of most operations is O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the map. This makes it
      efficient for large datasets.

8. **What is the Memory and HD costs?**
    - The memory cost is higher compared to non-concurrent data structures due to the additional data structures
      required for concurrency control. The exact memory usage depends on the number of elements and the implementation
      details. There should be no significant impact on the hard drive (HD) as this data structure is primarily stored
      in memory.

9. **What other data structure is similar?**
    - TreeMap is a similar non-concurrent data structure that provides sorted map functionality. ConcurrentHashMap can
      be used for concurrent key-value storage but doesn't maintain sorted order.

10. **Is it thread safe?**
    - Yes, ConcurrentSkipListMap is designed to be thread-safe for concurrent operations.

11. **How to make it immutable?**
    - You can make an immutable version of ConcurrentSkipListMap by wrapping it
      with `Collections.unmodifiableSortedMap()`.

12. **How to make it singleton?**
    - You can create a singleton ConcurrentSkipListMap by using the Singleton design pattern or by using an Enum
      singleton.

13. **What part of Java Memory this structure is stored (Heap, stack, other)?**
    - The ConcurrentSkipListMap, like most Java objects, is stored in the heap memory. It's a dynamic data structure
      that allocates memory on the heap as needed.

Remember that while ConcurrentSkipListMap is thread-safe, it might not always be the most efficient choice depending on
your specific use case. Always consider your application's requirements and performance characteristics when choosing a
data structure.
