Java 8 introduced several enhancements and features, but there is no specific change or update to the `IdentityHashMap`
data structure in Java 8. However, I can provide you with information about `IdentityHashMap` in general:

1. **When to use?**
    - Use `IdentityHashMap` when you need a Map that uses reference equality (==) rather than object equality (equals())
      to compare keys.
    - It is useful when you want to maintain a mapping of objects based on their memory addresses or object identity.

2. **Principal Usage:**
    - The primary use case is for scenarios where you need a Map that doesn't rely on the `equals()` and `hashCode()`
      methods of objects for key comparison. Instead, it uses reference equality.

3. **Main Advantage:**
    - The main advantage is its ability to use reference equality, which can be useful when working with mutable objects
      or when you specifically want to differentiate between distinct object instances.

4. **Main Disadvantage:**
    - The main disadvantage is that it does not follow the traditional contract of the `equals()` and `hashCode()`
      methods, which might lead to unexpected behavior if not used carefully.

5. **When Not to Use:**
    - Do not use `IdentityHashMap` when you need key comparison based on the actual content of objects, as it will not
      work as expected in such cases.

6. **Main Methods:**
    - Some common methods include `put()`, `get()`, `remove()`, `containsKey()`, and `size()`, similar to other Map
      implementations.

7. **Big O Cost:**
    - The time complexity for basic operations (like `put`, `get`, `remove`) is O(n), where n is the number of elements
      in the map.

8. **Memory and Hard Disk Costs:**
    - `IdentityHashMap` typically consumes more memory than `HashMap` because it needs to store references to keys
      without relying on their `hashCode()` and `equals()` methods.

9. **Similar Data Structure:**
    - `WeakHashMap` is somewhat similar in that it uses weak references for keys, allowing them to be garbage collected
      when no longer strongly referenced.

10. **Thread Safety:**
    - `IdentityHashMap` is not inherently thread-safe. If you need thread safety, you can
      use `Collections.synchronizedMap()` to wrap it.

11. **How to Make it Immutable:**
    - You can make it immutable by wrapping it using `Collections.unmodifiableMap()`.

12. **How to Make it Singleton:**
    - You can make a singleton `IdentityHashMap` instance by creating a private static final instance and providing a
      public static method to access it.

13. **Memory Storage:**
    - `IdentityHashMap` is typically stored on the heap since it deals with objects, and Java objects reside in the
      heap.

Remember that `IdentityHashMap` is not as commonly used as other `Map` implementations like `HashMap` or `TreeMap`. It
has specific use cases where identity-based comparison is necessary. In most cases, you would use other map
implementations that rely on `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods for key comparison.
