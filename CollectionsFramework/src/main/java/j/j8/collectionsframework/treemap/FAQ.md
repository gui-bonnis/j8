Certainly! I can provide you with information about the `TreeMap` data structure in Java 8 based on your questions:

**When to use `TreeMap` (Principal Usage):**

- Use `TreeMap` when you need to maintain a sorted collection of key-value pairs (entries) based on the natural order of
  keys or a custom comparator.
- It is ideal for scenarios where you need efficient insertion, deletion, and retrieval of elements while keeping them
  sorted.

**Main Advantage of `TreeMap`:**

- Provides efficient key-based operations with a guaranteed log(n) time complexity for basic operations like insertion,
  deletion, and search.

**Main Disadvantage of `TreeMap`:**

- `TreeMap` is not as performant as some other data structures, such as `HashMap`, for operations that do not require
  sorted keys.
- It consumes more memory than some other data structures due to the overhead of maintaining the tree structure.

**When Not to Use `TreeMap`:**

- If you don't need the elements to be sorted by their keys, consider using a `HashMap` for better performance.
- If you need thread safety, `ConcurrentHashMap` might be a better choice.

**Main Methods of `TreeMap`:**

- `put(key, value)`: Inserts a key-value pair into the map.
- `get(key)`: Retrieves the value associated with a key.
- `remove(key)`: Removes the entry with the specified key.
- `size()`: Returns the number of entries in the map.
- `clear()`: Removes all entries from the map.

**Big O Cost (Time Complexity):**

- `TreeMap` provides O(log n) time complexity for insertion, deletion, and search operations (
  e.g., `put`, `remove`, `get`).

**Memory and HD Costs:**

- `TreeMap` consumes more memory compared to some other data structures due to its tree-based implementation.
- The actual memory and hard disk (HD) costs depend on the number of entries and the size of the keys and values stored.

**Similar Data Structure:**

- `TreeSet` is a similar data structure that stores a sorted collection of unique elements, but it doesn't store
  key-value pairs.

**Thread Safety:**

- `TreeMap` is not inherently thread-safe. If you need thread safety, consider
  using `Collections.synchronizedSortedMap(new TreeMap<>())` to wrap it.

**How to Make it Immutable:**

- You can make a `TreeMap` immutable by creating an unmodifiable view of it
  using `Collections.unmodifiableSortedMap(treeMap)`.

**How to Make it Singleton:**

- To create a Singleton `TreeMap`, you can use the Singleton pattern to ensure that only one instance of `TreeMap` is
  created.

**Memory Storage:**

- `TreeMap` is stored in the heap memory, like most other Java objects. The actual memory usage depends on the number of
  entries and the size of the keys and values.

Keep in mind that in Java 8 and later versions, there have been further improvements and optimizations in data
structures and libraries, so it's essential to consider the specific version of Java and your application's requirements
when choosing a data structure.
