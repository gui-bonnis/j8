Sure, I'd be happy to answer your questions about ArrayList in Java 8.

1. **When to use?**
   - Use an ArrayList when you need a dynamic array-like data structure in Java. It's commonly used to store and manipulate a list of elements.

2. **What is the principal usage?**
   - ArrayList is used to store a collection of elements, and it allows for easy insertion, deletion, and retrieval of elements based on their index.

3. **What is the main advantage?**
   - The main advantage of ArrayList is its dynamic resizing. It can grow or shrink as needed, making it suitable for situations where you don't know the size of the list in advance.

4. **What is the main disadvantage?**
   - The main disadvantage is that inserting or removing elements in the middle of an ArrayList is relatively slow compared to other data structures like LinkedList. This is because elements may need to be shifted to accommodate the change.

5. **When not to use?**
   - Avoid using ArrayList when you need frequent insertions or deletions in the middle of the list. In such cases, LinkedList might be a better choice.

6. **What is the Big O cost?**
   - The average time complexity for common operations on an ArrayList is as follows:
      - Insertion/Deletion at the end: O(1) amortized time
      - Insertion/Deletion at the beginning or middle: O(n)
      - Accessing an element by index: O(1)

7. **What is the Memory and HD costs?**
   - ArrayList consumes memory for the elements it stores. The memory cost is proportional to the number of elements. It doesn't have a direct relation to the hard drive (HD) as it's a runtime data structure, but it can be serialized to disk if needed.

8. **What other data structure is similar?**
   - An alternative data structure similar to ArrayList is LinkedList. LinkedList is better suited for frequent insertions and deletions in the middle of the list.

9. **Is it thread safe?**
   - No, ArrayList is not inherently thread-safe. If you need thread safety, you should use synchronized collections or use concurrent collections like `CopyOnWriteArrayList`.

10. **How to make it immutable?**
   - You can make an ArrayList immutable by wrapping it with `Collections.unmodifiableList`. For example:

    ```java
    List<String> immutableList = Collections.unmodifiableList(originalList);
    ```

11. **How to make it singleton?**
   - To make an ArrayList a singleton (i.e., a list with a single element), you can simply add the element you want and ensure that no other elements are added or removed.

12. **What part of Java Memory this structure is stored (Heap, stack, other)?**
   - ArrayList, like most objects in Java, is stored in the heap memory. Stack memory is typically used for method call frames and local variables, while the heap is used for objects that have a longer lifetime. ArrayList's elements are also stored in the heap.

Please note that Java 8 has been superseded by newer versions of Java (e.g., Java 11, Java 17), but the concepts related to ArrayList remain largely consistent across Java versions.
